# Base architecture for office computers' setup

A series of states for SaltStack meant for easy installation and setup of several programs to office-type computers. Built as part of "Palvelinten Hallinta" (ICT4TN022-3014) course in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, run by Tero Karvinen.

Currently consists of only a basic setup that installs Firefox and Libreoffice to all machines, be they Windows or Linux, and adds one new document template for LibreOffice.

The intent is to add functionality for setting up ssh-connectivity for all machines, and additional programs. Potentionally also additional variable package-lists targeted to specific groups with the use of Salt environments and the Top-file.
